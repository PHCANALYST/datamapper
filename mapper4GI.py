# Load the GloVe word embedding model

# Load the source file

# Load the target file

# Create a mapping between the data elements in the source file and the data elements in the target file.
# This can be done manually or by using a tool like a data mapping tool.

# Train a generative model on the mapping.
# The generative model will learn to map the data elements in the source system to the data elements in the target system.

# Test the generative model.
# This can be done by giving the generative model a new set of data from the source system and seeing if it can correctly map the data to the target system.

# Deploy the generative model.
# The generative model can be deployed in a production environment so that it can be used to map data from the source system to the target system.
